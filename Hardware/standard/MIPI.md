MIPI Alliance specifications serve six fundamental application areas: physical layer, multimedia, chip-to-chip or interprocessor communications (IPC), control/data, and debug/trace and software.


五大部分：
- Physical layer—A family of high-speed physical layers to serve essential interconnection needs in a device
- Multimedia—Protocols for camera and imaging, display and touch, and a complete interface for audio
- Chip-to-chip/IPC—Protocol layers for chip-to-chip or interprocessor communications
Control and data—Interfaces to manage lower-speed components 
- Debug and trace—Tools for debugging embedded systems throughout the development lifecycle
- Software integration—Tools that streamline software integration of components in mobile-connected products
